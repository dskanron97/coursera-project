                        <p>More than 50 billion chickens are reared annually as a source of meat and eggs. In the United States alone, more than 8 billion chickens are slaughtered each year for meat, and more than 300 million chickens are reared for egg production.The vast majority of poultry are raised in factory farms. According to the Worldwatch Institute, 74 percent of the world's poultry meat and 68 percent of eggs are produced this way.An alternative to intensive poultry farming is free-range farming.Friction between these two main methods has led to long-term issues of ethical consumerism. Opponents of intensive farming argue that it harms the environment, creates human health risks and is inhumane.[49] Advocates of intensive farming say that their highly efficient systems save land and food resources owing to increased productivity, and that the animals are looked after in state-of-the-art environmentally controlled facilities.

                                Beef is the third most widely consumed meat in the world, accounting for about 25% of meat production worldwide, after pork and poultry at 38% and 30% respectively. In absolute numbers, the United States, Brazil, and the People's Republic of China are the world's three largest consumers of beef; Uruguay, however, has the highest beef and veal consumption per capita, followed by Argentina and Brazil.
                                 According to the data from OECD, the average Uruguayan ate over 42 kg (93 lb) of beef or veal in 2014, 
                                 representing the highest beef/veal consumption per capita in the world. In comparison, 
                                 the average American consumed only about 24 kg (53 lb) beef or veal in the same year,
                                  while African countries, such as Mozambique, Ghana, and Nigeria, consumed the least beef or veal per capita.

                                narizushi (稲荷寿司) is a pouch of fried tofu typically filled with sushi rice alone.

                                Tales tell that inarizushi is named after the Shinto god Inari. Foxes, messengers of Inari, are believed to have a fondness for fried tofu, and an Inari-zushi roll has pointed corners that resemble fox ears.Regional variations include pouches made of a thin omelette (帛紗寿司, fukusa-zushi, or 茶巾寿司, chakin-zushi) instead of tofu. It should not be confused with inari maki, which is a roll filled with flavored fried tofu.
                            Cone sushi is a variant of inarizushi originating in Hawaii that may include green beans, carrots, or gobo along with rice, wrapped in a triangular aburage piece. It is often sold in okazu-ya (Japanese delis) and as a component of bento boxes.
